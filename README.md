# Nonlinear-Dynamics-Code
A repository containing all the code I made for my AT Nonlinear Dynamics class

Most projects require Kivy and Kivy MD to run.
They should auto pip-install them (sorry, I still need to add a user prompt before installing) and if you don't want that then just remove the code inside the try-except blocks in the imports section.
