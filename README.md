# Nonlinear-Dynamics-Code
This is a repository containing all the code I made for my AT Nonlinear Dynamics class.
The projects in this repository all explore the theme of iteration and visualizing it in creative and unique ways. The course also emphasized GUI design and UX design.

A couple projects require Kivy and Kivy MD to run.
They should auto pip-install them (sorry, I still need to add a user prompt before installing) and if you don't want that then just remove the code inside the try-except blocks in the imports section.

Anybody can repurpose them for their own use. It would be awesome for people to actually learn a thing or two about Nonlinear Dynamics through the use of these programs, either with a goal in mind or just to mess around and see what interesting things they can create.
